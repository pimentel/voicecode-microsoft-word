# Microsoft Word package for VoiceCode

This package provides basic functionality for manipulating text in Microsoft Word with VoiceCode.
Currently, only Microsoft Word Mac is supported.
It has been tested quite a bit with Microsoft Word Mac 2016.

In addition to implementing most of the basic selection commands, `editor:move-to-line-number` (ðŸ”‰springðŸ”‰) can both jump between lines or pages.
The default is to jump between lines.
This can be changed by the command ðŸ”‰page modeðŸ”‰.
You can also switch back to line mode with the command ðŸ”‰line modeðŸ”‰.

## Behavior

Most behavior is as expected, except for the following:

- `editor:expand-selection-to-scope` (ðŸ”‰brackenðŸ”‰): will expand selection to word, sentence, paragraph, section, story
